Using a dataset that contain movies rating in letterbox, starting with utils.py file that has rows to json function, metadata function and create prompt template . Afterwards preprocessing data clean it to get the essential labels that we need in addition checking if the data is eligieble for implemantation for example checking the runtimes of the movies shortest to longest and its average, then the rows transformed into json file on data folder that contains the csv file by calling the function defined in utils.py file. Followed by creating a database, using jsonloader that has the path of the json file the label needed "Film_title" and calling the function metadata mention in utils.py file, checking the device to use cuda and start embedding using "BAAI/bge-m3" model, than the import step is the vector store chroma collection nadem "movies" and store it to doc. So there the chatbot.py file using "llama3.2:3b" set k=5 and prompt template to the function mentioned in utils.py as well, asssign the chroma to db setting the chain than adressing the loop that has the input where asked " What movie are you interested in?" provoque the chain and add to the chat history.
